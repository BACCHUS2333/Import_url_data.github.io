# Importing Data from URL
This repository provides a simple Python script for importing data from a URL into a Pandas DataFrame. The script utilizes the requests library to fetch the data from the specified URL and Pandas to read the CSV data into a DataFrame.

## Overview
Importing data from a URL can be useful when the dataset is hosted online and accessible via a URL link. This repository offers a straightforward method to fetch CSV data from a URL and load it into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis and processing.

## Contents
import_data_from_url.py: Python script for importing data from a URL into a Pandas DataFrame.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Requests
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/import-data-from-url.git
Navigate to the repository directory:

javascript
Copy code
cd import-data-from-url
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script import_data_from_url.py, providing the URL of the dataset:

bash
Copy code
python import_data_from_url.py --url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BACCHUS2333/Machine_Learning_Lasso_and_ridge_regression.github.io/main/College.csv
This command will import the data from the specified URL and display the DataFrame.

Dataset Format
The dataset should be in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format accessible via the provided URL. The script fetches the data from the URL and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame.


## Acknowledgments
This implementation is inspired by the need to easily import data from online sources for analysis and machine learning tasks.

### Remember, importing data from URLs is easier than asking your cat to fetch your dataset! üê±
